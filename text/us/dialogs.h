Also note that you don't have \n\

Requires long-jumping backwards\n\

sky-rocket and let you clip \n\
through once-solid walls. \n\
Finally: the Wall Kick. Jump\n\

Dev Talk: The Various\n\
Cream Outfits.\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
The Cream costumes were something\n\
I just did on a whim. My specialty \n\
is doing models and I wanted to\n\
give the player some extra outfits\n\
to go through Cream 64.\n\
Initially started as a set of 10,\n\
now here we are up to a grand\n\
total of 104 outfits. All the outfits\n\
are categorized as well:\n\
\n\
1-13 are official outfits seen in\n\
either the games, comics, Sonic X\n\
or in official art from Sonic Team\n\
and Sonic Channel. The last one isn't\n\
official but I just really like it.\n\
14-26 are outfits based on various\n\
Sonic characters, if it wasn't\n\
obvious enough. Originally just \n\
picking who was in the hack and\n\
then ended up adding a bit more.\n\
27-79 are personal picks either by\n\
how fitting, suggestions from\n\
others, wanting to rep a series I \n\
like or just finding it amusing.\n\
\n\
80-101 are good friend suggestions\n\
and streamer thanks with me asking\n\
who they like or me wanting to put\n\
their characters as outfits.\n\
\n\
102-104 are for my closest friends \n\
and me! One of the earliest alts\n\
I made for the hack and using the\n\
characters themselves rather than\n\
just an outfit. \n\
I could keep going with these but\n\
I ended up doing over 100 of\n\
these! Something for \n\
everyone, at least!\n\
\n\
My initial plan after this was\n\
to retire this Cream model, so\n\
at the very least, she's going\n\
out with a bang!\n\

Dev Talk: The Cream\n\
Model Herself.\n\

\n\

The original model for Cream\n\
before making an original\n\
model was her Heroes model.\n\
While it did work, after\n\
lowering the poly count, it\n\
just looks...weird. \n\
The current version is based of\n\
a ref image of the current model\n\
used nowadays. Funny enough,\n\
the head model is taken from \n\
her Chronicles model, just\n\
retextured.\n\
Later on, there was talk of\n\
using Marine's Rush head, but\n\
left the model as-is. The \n\
fixed-up head is now applied\n\
to Katalina, the bunny by \n\
TTC.\n\
I do have plans on redoing the \n\
model again at some point with\n\
a lower poly count, so this is\n\
kind of a swan song for this \n\
one. One final hurrah~"))

Dev Talk: The Chosen Set of\n\
Characters Among Other Things.\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
The original set of characters\n\
were chosen mainly due to their\n\
connection to Cream (in my own\n\
AU) as well as just who I \n\
personally wanted to use. \n\
\n\
I wanted to make sure I got\n\
everyone from the Rabbit family\n\
(Cream, Cheese, Vanilla, Chocola,\n\
and Gemerl) and anyone else was\n\
just extra.\n\
\n\
Blaze and Marine for the Rush\n\
connections, as well as Mark and\n\
Katalina cause of AU stuff.\n\
The design of the Egg Koopa was \n\
a 'what-if' that I'm glad \n\
came out great. \n\
Course, now there's many more\n\
characters hanging around here,\n\
including guest characters\n\
from friends. Since they're just\n\
visiting, no need to add a White\n\
Wisp for them.\n\
There's a lot of ideas I'd love\n\

crazy right now.\n\

those into a custom hack where\n\
they can serve a better purpose."))

Dev Talk: Streaming Audio, \n\
Self Control, and the paaains.\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
Streaming audio was a \n\
relatively late addition to the\n\
hack, given the release of\n\
audio-manager v0.1. I did kind of \n\
go a bit crazy with the new \n\
addition, so there were problems.\n\
There was plans to have more \n\
streaming audio, but I had appear\n\
to hit the vanilla hard cap, so I\n\
had to stop, otherwise the game\n\
would crash on start. \n\
\n\
This particular build can now \n\
handle much more .m64 (sequence\n\
files) without it crashing, so\n\
there's a bit more variety in\n\
places now. Still a few repeats\n\
as an emergency.\n\
Then there was the other problem\n\
of it being too large. It wouldn't\n\
run on certain emulators, and that\n\
needed fixing, hence going back \n\
and changing some songs back to\n\
midis.\n\
The goal was getting it back \n\
under 64 MB, so that it would \n\
run on RetroArch. PJ64 had no\n\
issue, but I wanted it running on\n\
Parallel. The end result was what \n\
we have now.\n\
Later turns out that I could\n\
avoid this by not using the\n\
highest possible compression\n\
for each new track. This version,\n\
with more songs, should be smaller\n\
than v1 for example.\n\
For the port to the PC version,\n\
I ran into another weird bug with\n\
streaming audio. The castle inside\n\
music had a strange crackle that\n\
I couldn't figure out. \n\
\n\
I wound up using a midi track to\n\
get past this problem, though I\n\
believe later builds of sm64ex\n\
seem to have fixed the problem.\n\
Not 100 percent sure.\n\
\n\
And don't get me started on the \n\
hassles of trying to port this\n\
to the 3DS. All the streaming just\n\
made things worse, hence why it has\n\
a completely different soundtrack.\n\
\n\
At the end of the day, this has been\n\
a lifesaver but also a huge burden.\n\
But I can't lie in that it's made\n\
things much easier for me in the\n\
long run."))
